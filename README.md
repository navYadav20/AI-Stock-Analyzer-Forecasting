## `About The Project`
This project was developed to provide investors with a modern, AI-enhanced tool that goes beyond simple price charts. Traditional analysis often requires juggling multiple sources and tools. This application consolidates key analytical functions into a single, user-friendly dashboard.

- The AI Stock Analyzer fetches real-time and historical stock data, then applies a three-pronged analysis:

- An AI Agent actively monitors for important technical signals.

- A Statistical Model provides short-term price forecasts.

- A Generative AI offers a qualitative long-term outlook.

- The result is a comprehensive dashboard that supports both US (NASDAQ) and Indian (NSE) markets, empowering users to make better-informed investment decisions.

## `Core Features`
AI Agent Watchdog: Proactively scans for and reports on key market signals at the click of a button:

- 7-Day average price vs. current price.

- Price alerts for significant deviations from the 30-day average.

- Trend analysis via Golden Cross and Death Cross (50-day vs. 200-day SMA) detections.

- AI-Powered News Sentiment: Leverages the Google Gemini API to analyze recent headlines and provide a concise, detailed sentiment summary with reasoning.

- Statistical Forecasting: Utilizes an ARIMA ML model to generate short-term price projections for the next 1, 3, or 6 months, complete with confidence intervals visualized on an interactive chart.

- Long-Term Fundamental Outlook: Employs the Gemini API to act as a financial analyst, generating a professional, qualitative summary of a stock's 1-3 year outlook, structured into pros and cons.

- Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface that works on both desktop and mobile.
